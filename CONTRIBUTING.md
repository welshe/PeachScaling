Thank you for your interest in contributing to PeachScaling! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our GPU-accelerated frame generation and upscaling application for macOS.

What Contributions Are Welcome

PeachScaling is a complex graphics application, and we welcome contributions in many areas. Whether you're a graphics programming expert or just getting started with Swift development, there are ways you can help improve the project.

Code contributions are the most direct way to improve PeachScaling. We're particularly interested in optimizations to the motion estimation algorithms, improvements to frame interpolation quality, and better Metal shader implementations. If you've worked with MetalFX or have experience with real-time graphics programming, your expertise would be valuable in improving our upscaling pipeline.

Bug reports and feature requests are equally important contributions. If you encounter issues while using PeachScaling or have ideas for new features, please let us know through GitHub Issues. Even if you can't fix the problem yourself, reporting it helps us understand what users need.

Documentation improvements help make the project more accessible to new contributors. If you find outdated information, unclear explanations, or gaps in our documentation, patches to improve it are always welcome.
